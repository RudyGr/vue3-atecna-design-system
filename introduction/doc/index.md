# Vue 3 Starter

This is a simple Vue.js-based Design System starter that you can build from to build your own Design System.

## Design tokens

This starter contains some design token examples implemented in [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) with SCSS.
You can head to any of them (for example [colors](../../colors/doc/colors.md)) and see the tokens being show cased in the documentation.

## Documentation

The documentation of this starter is written with [mdjs](https://backlight.dev/docs/mdjs), which allows us to easily incorporate Javascript and HTML into Markdown.

It uses [dockit-core](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-react), a library that comes with nice components for show-casing CSS Design Tokens as well as the documentation page layout, featuring light & dark toggles as well as a navigation menu to go through the various tokens and components.

## Components

The [Button](../../button/doc/button.md) component has some documentation, some stories and tests.

Stories are written using [Storybook's Component Story Format(CSF)](https://backlight.dev/docs/component-story-format).
The documentation leverages mdjs' capabilities to include visual examples and code blocks for references.

## Usage in your application

We have documentation on using a Backlight Design System in your application. It comes in different flavor depending on your use case:

- [generic procedure](https://backlight.dev/docs/using-ds)
- [with Nuxt 3](https://backlight.dev/docs/using-ds-on-nuxt3) - you can see an example using this starter [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-hy7suy?file=app.vue)
